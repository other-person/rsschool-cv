    <p>My goal is to get into the it sphere, because this is the future and this sphere has big potential.<br>
    I would like to constantly grow as front-end developer, as well as to develop team work skill. <br>
    The team is important because it creates an atmosphere in which you want to learn and develop. <br>
    I like to see process and final result of my work.</p>
    <p>I have some skills in Html and CSS. Also I am familiar with the SASS preprocessor, Bootstrap 4.</p>
    <p>I don&prime;t have the link to my work, only files with code.</p>
    <p>I have experience of creating a website in Html and native Css.</p>
    <p>At the beginning of this year summer, I was studying at the &Prime;IT Academy&Prime;.</p>
    <p>I haven&prime;t had any practice in a long time. Currently I work with a tutor. I want to consolidate the A2 level in the nearest future.</p>
